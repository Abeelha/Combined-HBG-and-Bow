Pure QoL and survivability overhaul for Heavy Bowgun. No damage multipliers — focused on guard effectiveness, energy recovery, special ammo accessibility, and mobility.

2. Download `release/HBG/`.
3. Place its contents into your Fluffy Mod Manager mods directory as a single mod.
4. Disable the standalone versions of all bundled mods listed below.
5. Enable Combined-HBG-Enhanced.

## How the merge was done

This section documents the full process for anyone who wants to replicate it or merge other conflicting mods.

### Prerequisites

- [MHWS Editor](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/401) (Synthlight's RE Engine .user file editor)
- The source `.user.3` files from each mod you want to merge

### Step 1: Export each mod's data to JSON

Open each `.user.3` file in MHWS Editor and use the Run Code feature to dump all parameters to a readable JSON file. Scripts are at `scripts/export_data.cs` (Bow / Wp11) and `scripts/export_hbg.cs` (HBG / Wp12). The HBG script filters out WPF color metadata that would otherwise bloat the output to 500KB+.

Paste the script into the Run Code window, hit Run, and it writes a JSON file to disk.

### Step 2: Diff the exports

Compare JSON exports to identify which fields each mod changes. The key categories are:

1. **Scatter lists** (shot spread patterns, arrays of X/Y coordinates) — Bow only
2. **Simple floats/ints** (charge times, damage rates, energy costs)
3. **Nested objects** (BottleParamData, MultiLockonParam, special ammo ChargeInfo)

### Step 3: Write a merge script

The merge scripts (`scripts/merge_script.cs`, `scripts/merge_hbg.cs`) are C# snippets that run inside MHWS Editor. Open the base file, paste the script into Run Code, run it, then save. The editor's typed API correctly handles nested RSZ objects, array indexing, and type casting.

### Step 4: Verify

Export the merged file using the same JSON export script and diff it against your expectations.

### Why binary patching does not work

`.user.3` files use RE Engine's RSZ serialization format — fields are not at fixed offsets, and nested objects contain their own serialized data. Patching the wrong bytes corrupts nested structures silently. Using the MHWS Editor scripting API avoids this entirely.
